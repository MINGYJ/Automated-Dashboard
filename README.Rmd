    4.  if it close while using it:

        1.  Maybe variable name is changed, we need to change the code for it

        2.  Maybe there is no submitted file in the selected period

        3.  If it is still solved, try see if there is more changed variables, or form_id changed

3.  What if the dashboard takes too long to start

    1.  Currently have no solutions, but the first time run the dashboard after restart R Studio will takes longer time to compile all the codes.
